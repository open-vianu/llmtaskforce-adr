6 ADVERSE REACTIONS
6.1 Clinical Trials Experience
Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction
rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the
clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.
Adverse Reactions in Adults
The data described herein reflect exposure to Infliximab in 4779 adult patients (1304
patients with RA, 1106 patients with CD, 202 with AS, 293 with PsA, 484 with UC, 1373
with Ps, and 17 patients with other conditions), including 2625 patients exposed beyond
30 weeks and 374 exposed beyond 1 year. [For information on adverse reactions in
pediatric patients see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] .One of the most-common reasons for
discontinuation of treatment was infusion-related reactions (e.g., dyspnea, flushing,
headache and rash).
Infusion-Related Reactions
Adverse Reactions During or Shortly After Infusion
An infusion reaction was defined in clinical trials as any adverse event occurring during
an infusion or within 1 hour after an infusion. In all the clinical studies, approximately
20% of Infliximab-treated patients experienced an infusion reaction compared with 10%
of placebo-treated patients. Of Infliximab-treated patients who had an infusion reaction
during the induction period, 27% experienced an infusion reaction during the
maintenance period. Of patients who did not have an infusion reaction during the
induction period, 9% experienced an infusion reaction during the maintenance period.
Among all Infliximab infusions, 3% were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as
fever or chills, 1% were accompanied by cardiopulmonary reactions (primarily chest
pain, hypotension, hypertension or dyspnea), and <1% were accompanied by pruritus,
urticaria, or the combined symptoms of pruritus/urticaria and cardiopulmonary
reactions. Serious infusion reactions occurred in <1% of patients and included
anaphylaxis, convulsions, erythematous rash and hypotension. Approximately 3% of
patients discontinued Infliximab because of infusion reactions, and all patients recovered
with treatment and/or discontinuation of the infusion. Infliximab infusions beyond the
initial infusion were not associated with a higher incidence of reactions. The infusion
reaction rates remained stable in Ps through 1 year in Ps Study I. In psoriasis Study II,
the rates were variable over time and somewhat higher following the final infusion than
after the initial infusion. Across the 3 Ps studies, the percent of total infusions resulting
in infusion reactions (i.e., an adverse event occurring within 1 hour) was 7% in the 3
mg/kg group, 4% in the 5 mg/kg group, and 1% in the placebo group.
Patients who became positive for antibodies to infliximab were more likely (approximately
two-to three-fold) to have an infusion reaction than were those who were negative. Use
of concomitant immunosuppressant agents appeared to reduce the frequency of both
antibodies to infliximab and infusion reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)and Drug
Interactions (7.3)] .
Infusion Reactions Following Re-administration
In a clinical trial of patients with moderate to severe Ps designed to assess the efficacy
of long-term maintenance therapy versus re-treatment with an induction regimen of
Infliximab following disease flare, 4% (8/219) of patients in the re-treatment induction
therapy arm experienced serious infusion reactions versus <1% (1/222) in the
maintenance therapy arm. Patients enrolled in this trial did not receive any concomitant
immunosuppressant therapy. In this study, the majority of serious infusion reactions
occurred during the second infusion at Week 2. Symptoms included, but were not
limited to, dyspnea, urticaria, facial edema, and hypotension. In all cases, Infliximab
treatment was discontinued and/or other treatment instituted with complete resolution
of signs and symptoms.
Delayed Reactions/Reactions Following Re-administration
In Ps studies, approximately 1% of Infliximab-treated patients experienced a possible
delayed hypersensitivity reaction, generally reported as serum sickness or a combination
of arthralgia and/or myalgia with fever and/or rash. These reactions generally occurred
within 2 weeks after repeat infusion.
Infections
In Infliximab clinical studies, treated infections were reported in 36% of Infliximab-treated
patients (average of 51 weeks of follow-up) and in 25% of placebo-treated patients
(average of 37 weeks of follow-up). The infections most frequently reported were
respiratory tract infections (including sinusitis, pharyngitis, and bronchitis) and urinary
tract infections. Among Infliximab-treated patients, serious infections included
pneumonia, cellulitis, abscess, skin ulceration, sepsis, and bacterial infection. In clinical
trials, 7 opportunistic infections were reported; 2 cases each of coccidioidomycosis (1
case was fatal) and histoplasmosis (1 case was fatal), and 1 case each of
pneumocystosis, nocardiosis and cytomegalovirus. Tuberculosis (TB) was reported in 14
patients, 4 of whom died due to miliary tuberculosis. Other cases of TB, including
disseminated TB, also have been reported post-marketing. Most of these cases of TB
occurred within the first 2 months after initiation of therapy with Infliximab and may
reflect recrudescence of latent disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . In the 1-
year placebo-controlled studies RA I and RA II, 5.3% of patients receiving Infliximab
every 8 weeks with MTX developed serious infections as compared to 3.4% of placebo
patients receiving MTX. Of 924 patients receiving Infliximab, 1.7% developed pneumonia
and 0.4% developed TB, when compared to 0.3% and 0.0% in the placebo arm
respectively. In a shorter (22-week) placebo-controlled study of 1082 RA patients
randomized to receive placebo, 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg Infliximab infusions at 0, 2, and 6
weeks, followed by every 8 weeks with MTX, serious infections were more frequent in
the 10 mg/kg Infliximab group (5.3%) than the 3 mg/kg or placebo groups (1.7% in
both). During the 54-week Crohn's II Study, 15% of patients with fistulizing CD
developed a new fistula-related abscess.
In Infliximab clinical studies in patients with UC, infections treated with antimicrobials
were reported in 27% of Infliximab-treated patients (average of 41 weeks of follow-up)
and in 18% of placebo-treated patients (average 32 weeks of follow-up). The types of
infections, including serious infections, reported in patients with UC were similar to those
reported in other clinical studies.
The onset of serious infections may be preceded by constitutional symptoms such as
fever, chills, weight loss, and fatigue. The majority of serious infections, however, may
also be preceded by signs or symptoms localized to the site of the infection.
Autoantibodies/Lupus-like Syndrome
Approximately half of Infliximab-treated patients in clinical trials who were antinuclear
antibody (ANA) negative at baseline developed a positive ANA during the trial compared
with approximately one-fifth of placebo-treated patients. Anti-dsDNA antibodies were
newly detected in approximately one-fifth of Infliximab-treated patients compared with
0% of placebo-treated patients. Reports of lupus and lupus-like syndromes, however,
remain uncommon.
Malignancies
In controlled trials, more Infliximab-treated patients developed malignancies than
placebo-treated patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] .
In a randomized controlled clinical trial exploring the use of Infliximab in patients with
moderate to severe COPD who were either current smokers or ex-smokers, 157
patients were treated with Infliximab at doses similar to those used in RA and CD. Of
these Infliximab-treated patients, 9 developed a malignancy, including 1 lymphoma, for a
rate of 7.67 cases per 100 patient-years of follow-up (median duration of follow-up 0.8
years; 95% CI 3.51 – 14.56). There was 1 reported malignancy among 77 control
patients for a rate of 1.63 cases per 100 patient-years of follow-up (median duration of
follow-up 0.8 years; 95% CI 0.04 – 9.10). The majority of the malignancies developed in
the lung or head and neck [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] .
Adverse Reactions in Patients with NYHA Class III/IV Heart Failure
In a randomized, double-blind study evaluating Infliximab in moderate or severe heart
failure (NYHA Class III/IV; left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35%), 150 patients were
randomized to receive treatment with 3 infusions of Infliximab 10 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, or
placebo, at 0, 2, and 6 weeks. Higher incidences of mortality and hospitalization due to
worsening heart failure were observed in patients receiving the 10 mg/kg Infliximab
dose. At 1 year, 8 patients in the 10 mg/kg Infliximab group had died compared with 4
deaths each in the 5 mg/kg Infliximab and the placebo groups. There were trends
toward increased dyspnea, hypotension, angina, and dizziness in both the 10 mg/kg and
5 mg/kg Infliximab treatment groups, versus placebo. Infliximab has not been studied in
patients with mild heart failure (NYHA Class I/II) [see Contraindications (4)and Warnings
and Precautions (5.5)] .
Hepatotoxicity
Severe liver injury, including acute liver failure and autoimmune hepatitis, has been
reported in patients receiving Infliximab [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] .
Reactivation of hepatitis B virus has occurred in patients receiving TNF blockers,
including Infliximab, who are chronic carriers of this virus [see Warnings and Precautions
(5.3)] .
In clinical trials in RA, CD, UC, AS, Ps, and PsA, elevations of aminotransferases were
observed (ALT more common than AST) in a greater proportion of patients receiving
Infliximab than in controls (Table 1), both when Infliximab was given as monotherapy
and when it was used in combination with other immunosuppressive agents. In general,
patients who developed ALT and AST elevations were asymptomatic, and the
abnormalities decreased or resolved with either continuation or discontinuation of
Infliximab, or modification of concomitant medications.

Adverse Reactions in Psoriasis Studies
During the placebo-controlled portion across the 3 clinical trials up to Week 16, the
proportion of patients who experienced at least 1 serious adverse reaction (SAE; defined
as resulting in death, life threatening, requires hospitalization, or persistent or significant
disability/incapacity) was 0.5% in the 3 mg/kg Infliximab group, 1.9% in the placebo
group, and 1.6% in the 5 mg/kg Infliximab group.
Among patients in the 2 Phase 3 studies, 12.4% of patients receiving Infliximab 5 mg/kg
Placebo patients received methotrexate while Infliximab patients received both
Infliximab and methotrexate. Median follow-up was 58 weeks.
Placebo patients in the 2 Phase 3 trials in CD received an initial dose of 5 mg/kg
Infliximab at study start and were on placebo in the maintenance phase.
Patients who were randomized to the placebo maintenance group and then
later crossed over to Infliximab are included in the Infliximab group in ALT
analysis. Median follow-up was 54 weeks.
Median follow-up was 30 weeks. Specifically, the median duration of follow-up
was 30 weeks for placebo and 31 weeks for Infliximab.
Median follow-up was 24 weeks for the placebo group and 102 weeks for the
Infliximab group.
Median follow-up was 39 weeks for the Infliximab group and 18 weeks for the
placebo group.
ALT values are obtained in 2 Phase 3 Ps studies with median follow-up of 50
weeks for Infliximab and 16 weeks for placebo.

every 8 weeks through 1 year of maintenance treatment experienced at least 1 SAE in
Study I. In Study II, 4.1% and 4.7% of patients receiving Infliximab 3 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg
every 8 weeks, respectively, through 1 year of maintenance treatment experienced at
least 1 SAE.
One death due to bacterial sepsis occurred 25 days after the second infusion of 5
mg/kg Infliximab. Serious infections included sepsis, and abscesses. In Study I, 2.7% of
patients receiving Infliximab 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks through 1 year of maintenance
treatment experienced at least 1 serious infection. In Study II, 1.0% and 1.3% of
patients receiving Infliximab 3 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg, respectively, through 1 year of
treatment experienced at least 1 serious infection. The most common serious infection
(requiring hospitalization) was abscess (skin, throat, and peri-rectal) reported by 5
(0.7%) patients in the 5 mg/kg Infliximab group. Two active cases of tuberculosis were
reported: 6 weeks and 34 weeks after starting Infliximab.
In the placebo-controlled portion of the Ps studies, 7 of 1123 patients who received
Infliximab at any dose were diagnosed with at least one NMSC compared to 0 of 334
patients who received placebo.
In the Ps studies, 1% (15/1373) of patients experienced serum sickness or a
combination of arthralgia and/or myalgia with fever, and/or rash, usually early in the
treatment course. Of these patients, 6 required hospitalization due to fever, severe
myalgia, arthralgia, swollen joints, and immobility.
Other Adverse Reactions in Adults
Safety data are available from 4779 Infliximab-treated adult patients, including 1304 with
RA, 1106 with CD, 484 with UC, 202 with AS, 293 with PsA, 1373 with Ps and 17 with
other conditions. [For information on other adverse reactions in pediatric patients, see
Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Adverse reactions reported in ≥5% of all patients with RA
receiving 4 or more infusions are in Table 2. The types and frequencies of adverse
reactions observed were similar in Infliximab-treated RA, AS, PsA, Ps, and CD patients
except for abdominal pain, which occurred in 26% of Infliximab-treated patients with CD.
In the CD studies, there were insufficient numbers and duration of follow-up for patients
who never received Infliximab to provide meaningful comparisons.

Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients
Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients with Crohn's Disease
There were some differences in the adverse reactions observed in the pediatric patients
receiving Infliximab compared to those observed in adults with CD. These differences
are discussed in the following paragraphs.
The following adverse reactions were reported more commonly in 103 randomized
pediatric CD patients administered 5 mg/kg Infliximab through 54 weeks than in 385
adult CD patients receiving a similar treatment regimen: anemia (11%), leukopenia (9%),
flushing (9%), viral infection (8%), neutropenia (7%), bone fracture (7%), bacterial
infection (6%), and respiratory tract allergic reaction (6%).
Infections were reported in 56% of randomized pediatric patients in Study Peds Crohn's
and in 50% of adult patients in Study Crohn's I. In Study Peds Crohn's, infections were
reported more frequently for patients who received every 8-week as opposed to every
12-week infusions (74% and 38%, respectively), while serious infections were reported
for 3 patients in the every 8-week and 4 patients in the every 12-week maintenance
treatment group. The most commonly reported infections were upper respiratory tract
infection and pharyngitis, and the most commonly reported serious infection was
abscess. Pneumonia was reported for 3 patients, (2 in the every 8-week and 1 in the
every 12-week maintenance treatment groups). Herpes zoster was reported for 2
patients in the every 8-week maintenance treatment group.
In Study Peds Crohn's, 18% of randomized patients experienced 1 or more infusion
reactions, with no notable difference between treatment groups. Of the 112 patients in
Study Peds Crohn's, there were no serious infusion reactions, and 2 patients had nonserious anaphylactoid reactions.
Elevations of ALT up to 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were seen in 18% of
pediatric patients in CD clinical trials; 4% had ALT elevations ≥3 × ULN, and 1% had
elevations ≥5 × ULN. (Median follow-up was 53 weeks).
Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients with Ulcerative Colitis
Overall, the adverse reactions reported in the pediatric UC trial and adult UC (Study UC I
and Study UC II) studies were generally consistent. In a pediatric UC trial, the most
common adverse reactions were upper respiratory tract infection, pharyngitis,
abdominal pain, fever, and headache.
Infections were reported in 31 (52%) of 60 treated patients in the pediatric UC trial and
22 (37%) required oral or parenteral antimicrobial treatment. The proportion of patients
with infections in the pediatric UC trial was similar to that in the pediatric CD study (Study
Peds Crohn's) but higher than the proportion in the adults' UC studies (Study UC I and
Study UC II). The overall incidence of infections in the pediatric UC trial was 13/22 (59%)
in the every 8 week maintenance treatment group. Upper respiratory tract infection
(7/60 [12%]) and pharyngitis (5/60 [8%]) were the most frequently reported respiratory
system infections. Serious infections were reported in 12% (7/60) of all treated patients.
Elevations of ALT up to 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were seen in 17%
(10/60) of pediatric patients in the pediatric UC trial; 7% (4/60) had ALT elevations ≥3 ×
ULN, and 2% (1/60) had elevations ≥5 × ULN (median follow-up was 49 weeks).
Overall, 8 of 60 (13%) treated patients experienced one or more infusion reactions,
including 4 of 22 (18%) patients in the every 8-week treatment maintenance group. No
serious infusion reactions were reported.
In the pediatric UC trial, 45 patients were in the 12 to 17 year age group and 15 in the 6
to 11 year age group. The numbers of patients in each subgroup are too small to make
any definitive conclusions about the effect of age on safety events. There were higher
proportions of patients with serious adverse events (40% vs. 18%) and discontinuation
due to adverse events (40% vs. 16%) in the younger age group than in the older age
group. While the proportion of patients with infections was also higher in the younger
age group (60% vs. 49%), for serious infections, the proportions were similar in the two
age groups (13% in the 6 to 11 year age group vs. 11% in the 12 to 17 year age group).
Overall proportions of adverse reactions, including infusion reactions, were similar
between the 6 to 11 and 12 to 17 year age groups (13%).
6.2 Immunogenicity
As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of
antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay.
Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody)
positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, including assay methodology,
sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying
disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies in the studies
described below with the incidence of antibodies in other studies or to other infliximab
products may be misleading.
Treatment with Infliximab can be associated with the development of antibodies to
infliximab. An enzyme immunoassay (EIA) method was originally used to measure antiinfliximab antibodies in clinical studies of Infliximab. The EIA method is subject to
interference by serum infliximab, possibly resulting in an underestimation of the rate of
patient antibody formation. A separate, drug-tolerant electrochemiluminescence
immunoassay (ECLIA) method for detecting antibodies to infliximab was subsequently
developed and validated. This method is 60-fold more sensitive than the original EIA.
With the ECLIA method, all clinical samples can be classified as either positive or negative
for antibodies to infliximab without the need for the inconclusive category.
The incidence of antibodies to infliximab was based on the original EIA method in all
clinical studies of Infliximab except for the Phase 3 study in pediatric patients with UC
where the incidence of antibodies to infliximab was detected using both the EIA and
ECLIA methods.
Immunogenicity in Adult Patients
The incidence of antibodies to infliximab in patients with RA and CD given a 3-dose
induction regimen followed by maintenance dosing was approximately 10% as assessed
through 1 to 2 years of Infliximab treatment. A higher incidence of antibodies to
infliximab was observed in CD patients receiving Infliximab after drug-free intervals >16
weeks. In a PsA study in which 191 patients received 5 mg/kg with or without MTX,
antibodies to infliximab occurred in 15% of patients. The majority of antibody-positive
patients had low titers. Antibody development was lower among RA and CD patients
receiving immunosuppressant therapies such as 6-MP/AZA or MTX. Patients who were
antibody-positive were more likely to have higher rates of clearance, have reduced
efficacy, and to experience an infusion reaction than were patients who were antibody
negative [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . In the Ps Study II, which included both the 5
mg/kg and 3 mg/kg doses, antibodies were observed in 36% of patients treated with 5
mg/kg every 8 weeks for 1 year, and in 51% of patients treated with 3 mg/kg every 8
weeks for 1 year.
In the Ps Study III, which also included both the 5 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg doses, antibodies
were observed in 20% of patients treated with 5 mg/kg induction (weeks 0, 2 and 6),
and in 27% of patients treated with 3 mg/kg induction. Despite the increase in antibody
formation, the infusion reaction rates in Studies I and II in patients treated with 5 mg/kg
induction followed by every 8 week maintenance for 1 year and in Study III in patients
treated with 5 mg/kg induction (14.1%–23.0%) and serious infusion reaction rates
(<1%) were similar to those observed in other study populations. The clinical significance
of apparent increased immunogenicity on efficacy and infusion reactions in Ps patients
as compared to patients with other diseases treated with Infliximab over the long term is
not known.
Immunogenicity in Pediatric Patients with Crohn's Disease
In Study Peds Crohn's, in which all patients received stable doses of 6-MP, AZA, or MTX,
excluding inconclusive samples, 3 of 24 patients had antibodies to infliximab. Although
105 patients were tested for antibodies to infliximab, 81 patients were classified as
inconclusive because they could not be ruled as negative due to assay interference by
the presence of infliximab in the sample.
Immunogenicity in Pediatric Patients with Ulcerative Colitis
In the pediatric UC trial, 58 patients were evaluated for antibodies to infliximab using the
EIA as well as the drug-tolerant ECLIA. With the EIA, 4 of 58 (7%) patients had
antibodies to infliximab. With the ECLIA, 30 of 58 (52%) patients had antibodies to
infliximab. The higher incidence of antibodies to infliximab by the ECLIA method was due
to the 60-fold higher sensitivity compared to the EIA method. While EIA-positive patients
generally had undetectable trough infliximab concentrations, ECLIA-positive patients
could have detectable trough concentrations of infliximab because the ECLIA assay is
more sensitive and drug-tolerant.
6.3 Postmarketing Experience
Adverse reactions, some with fatal outcomes, have been identified during post approval
use of Infliximab in adult and pediatric patients. Because these reactions are reported
voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably
estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.
Postmarketing Adverse Reactions in Adults and Pediatric Patients
