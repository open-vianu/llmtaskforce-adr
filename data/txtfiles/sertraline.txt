6.1 Clinical Trials Experience
Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction
rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the
clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.
The safety of Sertraline HCl Capsules for the treatment of MDD and OCD is based on
adequate and well-controlled studies of another sertraline HCl product. Below is a display
of adverse reactions of sertraline HCl (referred to as “sertraline” in this section) from
those adequate and well-controlled studies in MDD, OCD, and other conditions.
The data described below reflect exposure in randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled trials of sertraline in 3066 adults. These 3066 patients exposed to sertraline
for 8 to 12 weeks represent 568 patient-years of exposure. The mean age was 40
years; 57% were females and 43% were males.
The most common adverse reactions (≥5% and twice placebo) in all pooled placebocontrolled clinical trials of all sertraline-treated patients (MDD, OCD, and other conditions)
were nausea, diarrhea/loose stool, tremor, dyspepsia, decreased appetite,
hyperhidrosis, ejaculation failure, and decreased libido (see Table 2). The following are
the most common adverse reactions in trials of sertraline (≥5% and twice placebo) by
indication that were not mentioned previously.
MDD: somnolence
OCD: insomnia, agitation

Denominator used was for male patients only (n=1316 sertraline; n=973 placebo).
Adverse reactions that occurred greater than 2% in sertraline hydrochloride-treated
patients and at least 2% greater in sertraline hydrochloride-treated patients than
placebo-treated patients.

Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation in Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trials
In all placebo-controlled studies, 368 (12%) of the 3066 patients who received sertraline
discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction, compared with 93 (4%) of the 2293
placebo-treated patients. In placebo-controlled studies, the following were the common
adverse reactions leading to discontinuation in sertraline-treated patients:

All sertraline -treated patients (MDD, OCD, and Other Conditions): nausea (3%),
diarrhea (2%), agitation (2%), and insomnia (2%).
MDD (>2% and twice placebo): decreased appetite, dizziness, fatigue, headache,
somnolence, tremor, and vomiting.
OCD: somnolence.
Male and Female Sexual Dysfunction
Although changes in sexual desire, sexual performance and sexual satisfaction often
occur as manifestations of a psychiatric disorder, they may also be a consequence of
SSRI treatment. However, reliable estimates of the incidence and severity of untoward
experiences involving sexual desire, performance and satisfaction are difficult to obtain,
in part because patients and healthcare providers may be reluctant to discuss them.
Accordingly, estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance
cited in labeling may underestimate their actual incidence.
Table 3 below displays the incidence of sexual adverse reactions reported by at least 2%
of sertraline -treated patients and twice placebo from pooled placebo-controlled trials of
MDD, OCD, and other conditions. For men and all indications, the most common adverse
reactions (>2% and twice placebo) included: ejaculation failure, decreased libido, erectile
dysfunction, ejaculation disorder, and male sexual dysfunction. For women, the most
common adverse reaction (≥2% and twice placebo) was decreased libido.

Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients
In 281 pediatric patients treated with sertraline in placebo-controlled studies, the overall
profile of adverse reactions was generally similar to that seen in adult studies. Adverse
reactions that do not appear in Table 2 (most common adverse reactions in adults) yet
were reported in at least 2% of pediatric patients and at a rate of at least twice the
placebo rate include fever, hyperkinesia, urinary incontinence, aggression, epistaxis,
purpura, arthralgia, decreased weight, muscle twitching, and anxiety.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

another sertraline product. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a
population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency
or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

ventricular tachycardia (including Torsade de Pointes) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]
