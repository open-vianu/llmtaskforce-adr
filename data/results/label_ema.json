Grade 3 or higher CRS (Lee et al, 2014) occurred in 5.1% of patients, with fatal \n(Grade 5) CRS reported in 0.7% of patients. The median time-to-onset, any grade, was 1 day \n(range: 1 to 17) and the median duration of CRS was 4 days (range: 1 to 63). \n \nThe most common manifestations of CRS (\u2265 10%) included pyrexia (82.6%), hypotension (29.1%), \ntachycardia (24.7%), chills (18.8%), hypoxia (15.9%), headache (11.2%) and increased C-reactive \nprotein (10.5%). Grade 3 or higher events that may be observed in association with CRS included \natrial fibrillation, capillary leak syndrome, hypotension, hypoxia and HLH/MAS. \n \nOf the 409 patients, 59.7% of patients received tocilizumab; 37.2% received a single dose while \n22.5% received more than 1 dose of tocilizumab for treatment of CRS. Overall, 22.7% of patients \nreceived at least 1 dose of corticosteroids for treatment of CRS. Of the 92 patients in KarMMa and \nCRB-401 who received the target dose of 450 x 106 CAR-positive T cells, 54.3% of patients received \ntocilizumab and 22.8% received at least 1 dose of corticosteroids for treatment of CRS. Of the \n225 patients in KarMMa-3 who received Abecma infusion, 71.6% of patients received tocilizumab \nand 28.4% received at least 1 dose of corticosteroids for the treatment of CRS. See section 4.4 for \nmonitoring and management guidance. \n \nNeurologic adverse reactions including ICANS \nIn the pooled studies, of the 409 patients, independent of investigator attribution of neurotoxicity, the \nmost frequent neurologic or psychiatric adverse reactions (\u2265 5%) included headache (22.5%), \ndizziness (12.5%), confusional state (11.0%), insomnia (10.3%), anxiety (5.9%), tremor (5.6%), and \nsomnolence (5.6%). Other neurological adverse reactions occurring at a lower frequency and \nconsidered clinically important included encephalopathy (3.4%) and aphasia (2.9%). \n \nNeurotoxicity identified by the investigators, which was the primary method of assessing CAR T cell \nassociated- neurotoxicity in the KarMMa and KarMMa-3 studies, occurred in 57 (16.1%) of the \n353 patients receiving Abecma, including Grade 3 or 4 in 3.1% of patients (with no Grade 5 events). \nThe median time to onset of the first event was 3 days (range: 1 to 317; one patient developed \nencephalopathy at Day 317 as a result of worsening pneumonia and Clostridium difficile colitis). The \nmedian duration was 3 days (range: 1 to 252; one patient developed neurotoxicity [highest Grade 3] \n43 days after ide-cel infusion which resolved after 252 days). Overall, 7.1% of patients received at \nleast 1 dose of corticosteroid for treatment of CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity. \n \nIn KarMMa, across the target dose levels, 7.8% of patients received at least 1 dose of corticosteroid \nfor treatment of CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity, while at the target dose of 450 x 106 CAR-\npositive T cells, 14.8% of patients received at least 1 dose of corticosteroids. \n \nIn KarMMa-3, across all patients who received Abecma infusion at the target dose range, 6.7% of \npatients received at least 1 dose of corticosteroid for treatment of CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity. \n \n17 \nOf the 353 patients in the KarMMa and KarMMa-3 studies, the most common manifestations of \ninvestigator identified neurotoxicity (\u2265 2%) included confusional state (8.5%), encephalopathy (3.4%), \nsomnolence (2.8%), aphasia (2.5%), tremor (2.3%), disturbance in attention (2.0%) and dysgraphia \n(2.0%). See section 4.4 for monitoring and management guidance. \n \nFebrile neutropenia and infections \nIn the pooled studies, infections occurred in 62.8% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 infections occurred in \n23.2% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 infections with an unspecified pathogen occurred in 15.2%, viral \ninfections in 7.6%, bacterial infections in 4.6% and fungal infections in 1.2% of patients. Fatal \ninfections of unspecified pathogen were reported in 2.0% of patients, 0.7% of patients had fatal fungal \nor viral infection and 0.2% of patients had fatal bacterial infection. See section 4.4 for monitoring and \nmanagement guidance. \n \nFebrile neutropenia (Grade 3 or 4) was observed in 10.8% of patients after Abecma infusion. Febrile \nneutropenia may be concurrent with CRS. See section 4.4 for monitoring and management guidance. \n \nProlonged cytopenia \nPatients may exhibit prolonged cytopenias following lymphodepleting chemotherapy and Abecma \ninfusion. In the pooled studies, 38.2% of the 395 patients who had Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and \n71.3% of the 230 patients who had Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia during the first month following \nAbecma infusion had not resolved by last assessment during the first month. Among the 151 patients \nwith neutropenia not resolved by month 1, 88.7% recovered from Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia with a \nmedian time to recovery from Abecma infusion of 1.9 months. Of the 164 patients with \nthrombocytopenia not resolved by month 1, 79.9% recovered from Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia \nwith the median time to recovery of 2.0 months. See section 4.4 for monitoring and management \nguidance. \n \nHypogammaglobulinaemia \nHypogammaglobulinaemia was reported in 13.7% of patients treated with Abecma in the pooled \nstudies with a median time to onset of 90 days (range 1 to 326). See section 4.4 for monitoring and \nmanagement guidance. \n \nImmunogenicity \n \nAbecma has the potential to induce anti-CAR antibodies. In clinical studies, humoral immunogenicity \nof Abecma was measured by determination of anti-CAR antibody in serum pre- and post-\nadministration. In the pooled studies of KarMMa, CRB-401 and KarMMa-3, 3.2% of patients tested \npositive for pre-infusion anti-CAR antibodies and post-infusion anti-CAR antibodies were detected in \n56.2% of the patients. There is no evidence that the presence of pre-existing or post-infusion anti-CAR \nantibodies impact the cellular expansion, safety or effectiveness of Abecma. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.

This group of medical terms \nmay involve the same underlying pathophysiology (e.g. arterial thromboembolic reactions include \ncerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, transient ischaemic attack and other arterial \nthromboembolic reactions). \nb For additional information refer below within section \"Further information on selected serious \nadverse reactions\" \nc For further information please refer to Table 3 'Adverse reactions reported in post-marketing setting.' \nd Recto-vaginal fistulae are the most common fistulae in the GI-vaginal fistula category. \nDescription of selected serious adverse reactions \nGastrointestinal (GI) perforations and fistulae (see section 4.4) \nBevacizumab has been associated with serious cases of gastrointestinal perforation. \n \nGastrointestinal perforations have been reported in clinical trials with an incidence of less than 1% in \npatients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, up to 1.3% in patients with metastatic breast \ncancer, up to 2.0% in patients with metastatic renal cell cancer or in patients with ovarian cancer, and \nup to 2.7% (including gastrointestinal fistula and abscess) in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. \nFrom a clinical trial in patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer (study \nGOG-0240), GI perforations (all grade) were reported in 3.2% of patients, all of whom had a history \nof prior pelvic radiation. \n16 \n \nThe occurrence of those events varied in type and severity, ranging from free air seen on the plain \nabdominal X-ray, which resolved without treatment, to intestinal perforation with abdominal abscess \nand fatal outcome. In some cases underlying intra-abdominal inflammation was present, either from \ngastric ulcer disease, tumour necrosis, diverticulitis, or chemotherapy-associated colitis. \n \nFatal outcome was reported in approximately a third of serious cases of gastrointestinal perforations, \nwhich represents between 0.2%-1% of all bevacizumab treated patients. \n \nIn bevacizumab clinical trials, gastrointestinal fistulae (all grade) have been reported with an incidence \nof up to 2% in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and ovarian cancer, but were also reported \nless commonly in patients with other types of cancer. \n \nGI-vaginal fistulae in study GOG-0240 \nIn a trial of patients with persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer, the incidence of GI-vaginal \nfistulae was 8.3% in bevacizumab-treated patients and 0.9% in control patients, all of whom had a \nhistory of prior pelvic radiation. The frequency of GI-vaginal fistulae in the group treated with \nbevacizumab + chemotherapy was higher in patients with recurrence within the field of prior radiation \n(16.7%) compared with patients with no prior radiation and/ or no recurrence inside the field of prior \nradiation (3.6%). The corresponding frequencies in the control group receiving chemotherapy alone \nwere 1.1% vs. 0.8%, respectively. Patients who develop GI-vaginal fistulae may also have bowel \nobstructions and require surgical intervention as well as diverting ostomies. \n \nNon-GI fistulae (see section 4.4) \nBevacizumab use has been associated with serious cases of fistulae including reactions resulting in \ndeath. \n \nFrom a clinical trial in patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer (GOG-240), \n1.8% of bevacizumab-treated patients and 1.4% of control patients were reported to have had \nnon-gastrointestinal vaginal, vesical, or female genital tract fistulae. \n \nUncommon (\u2265 0.1% to < 1%) reports of fistulae that involve areas of the body other than the \ngastrointestinal tract (e.g. bronchopleural and biliary fistulae) were observed across various \nindications. Fistulae have also been reported in post-marketing experience. \n \nReactions were reported at various time points during treatment ranging from one week to greater than \n1 year from initiation of bevacizumab, with most reactions occurring within the first 6 months of \ntherapy. \n \nWound healing (see section 4.4) \nAs bevacizumab may adversely impact wound healing, patients who had major surgery within the last \n28 days were excluded from participation in phase III clinical trials. \n \nIn clinical trials of metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum, there was no increased risk of \npost-operative bleeding or wound healing complications observed in patients who underwent major \nsurgery 28-60 days prior to starting bevacizumab. An increased incidence of post-operative bleeding \nor wound healing complication occurring within 60 days of major surgery was observed if the patient \nwas being treated with bevacizumab at the time of surgery. The incidence varied between 10% (4/40) \nand 20% (3/15). \n \nSerious wound healing complications, including anastomotic complications, have been reported, some \nof which had a fatal outcome. \n \nIn locally recurrent and metastatic breast cancer trials, Grade 3-5 wound healing complications were \nobserved in up to 1.1% of patients receiving bevacizumab compared with up to 0.9% of patients in the \ncontrol arms (NCI-CTCAE v.3). \n17 \n \nIn clinical trials of ovarian cancer, Grade 3-5 wound healing complications were observed in up to \n1.8% of patients in the bevacizumab arm versus 0.1% in the control arm (NCI-CTCAE v.3). \n \nHypertension (see section 4.4) \nIn clinical trials, with the exception of study JO25567, the overall incidence of hypertension (all \ngrades) ranged up to 42.1% in the bevacizumab containing arms compared with up to 14% in the \ncontrol arms. The overall incidence of NCI-CTC Grade 3 and 4 hypertension in patients receiving \nbevacizumab ranged from 0.4% to 17.9%. Grade 4 hypertension (hypertensive crisis) occurred in up to \n1.0% of patients treated with bevacizumab and chemotherapy compared to up to 0.2% of patients \ntreated with the same chemotherapy alone. \n \nIn study JO25567, all grade hypertension was observed in 77.3% of the patients who received \nbevacizumab in combination with erlotinib as first-line treatment for non-squamous NSCLC with \nEGFR activating mutations, compared to 14.3% of patients treated with erlotinib alone. Grade 3 \nhypertension was 60.0% in patients treated with bevacizumab in combination with erlotinib compared \nto 11.7% in patients treated with erlotinib alone. There were no grade 4 or 5 hypertension events. \n \nHypertension was generally adequately controlled with oral anti-hypertensives such as angiotensin- \nconverting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics and calcium-channel blockers. It rarely resulted in \ndiscontinuation of bevacizumab treatment or hospitalisation. \n \nVery rare cases of hypertensive encephalopathy have been reported, some of which were fatal. \n \nThe risk of bevacizumab-associated hypertension did not correlate with the patients\u2019 baseline \ncharacteristics, underlying disease or concomitant therapy. \n \nPosterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (see section 4.4) \nThere have been rare reports of bevacizumab-treated patients developing signs and symptoms that are \nconsistent with PRES, a rare neurological disorder. Presentation may include seizures, headache, \naltered mental status, visual disturbance, or cortical blindness, with or without associated \nhypertension. The clinical presentation of PRES is often nonspecific, and therefore the diagnosis of \nPRES requires confirmation by brain imaging, preferably MRI. \n \nIn patients developing PRES, early recognition of symptoms with prompt treatment of specific \nsymptoms including control of hypertension (if associated with severe uncontrolled hypertension) is \nrecommended in addition to discontinuation of bevacizumab therapy. Symptoms usually resolve or \nimprove within days after treatment discontinuation, although some patients have experienced some \nneurologic sequelae. The safety of reinitiating bevacizumab therapy in patients previously \nexperiencing PRES is not known. \n \nAcross clinical trials, 8 cases of PRES have been reported. Two of the eight cases did not have \nradiological confirmation via MRI. \n \nProteinuria (see section 4.4) \nIn clinical trials, proteinuria has been reported within the range of 0.7% to 54.7% of patients receiving \nbevacizumab. \n \nProteinuria ranged in severity from clinically asymptomatic, transient, trace proteinuria to nephrotic \nsyndrome, with the great majority as Grade 1 proteinuria (NCI-CTCAE v.3). Grade 3 proteinuria was \nreported in up to 10.9% of treated patients. Grade 4 proteinuria (nephrotic syndrome) was seen in up \nto 1.4% of treated patients. Testing for proteinuria is recommended prior to start of bevacizumab \ntherapy. In most clinical trials urine protein levels of \u2265 2g/24 hrs led to the holding of bevacizumab \nuntil recovery to < 2g/24 hrs. \n18 \n \nHaemorrhage (see section 4.4) \nIn clinical trials across all indications the overall incidence of NCI-CTCAE v.3 Grade 3-5 bleeding \nreactions ranged from 0.4% to 6.9% in bevacizumab treated patients, compared with up to 4.5% of \npatients in the chemotherapy control group. \n \nFrom a clinical trial in patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer (study \nGOG-0240), grade 3-5 bleeding reactions have been reported in up to 8.3% of patients treated with \nbevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel and topotecan compared with up to 4.6% of patients \ntreated with paclitaxel and topotecan. \n \nThe haemorrhagic reactions that have been observed in clinical trials were predominantly \ntumour-associated haemorrhage (see below) and minor mucocutaneous haemorrhage (e.g. epistaxis). \n \nTumour-associated haemorrhage (see section 4.4) \nMajor or massive pulmonary haemorrhage/haemoptysis has been observed primarily in trials in \npatients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Possible risk factors include squamous cell \nhistology, treatment with antirheumatic/anti-inflammatory substances, treatment with anticoagulants, \nprior radiotherapy, bevacizumab therapy, previous medical history of atherosclerosis, central tumour \nlocation and cavitation of tumours prior to or during therapy. The only variables that showed \nstatistically significant correlations with bleeding were bevacizumab therapy and squamous cell \nhistology. Patients with NSCLC of known squamous cell histology or mixed cell type with \npredominant squamous cell histology were excluded from subsequent phase III trials, while patients \nwith unknown tumour histology were included. \n \nIn patients with NSCLC excluding predominant squamous histology, all Grade reactions were seen \nwith a frequency of up to 9.3% when treated with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy compared with up \nto 5% in the patients treated with chemotherapy alone. Grade 3-5 reactions have been observed in up \nto 2.3% of patients treated with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy as compared with < 1% with \nchemotherapy alone (NCI-CTCAE v.3). Major or massive pulmonary haemorrhage/haemoptysis can \noccur suddenly and up to two thirds of the serious pulmonary haemorrhages resulted in a fatal \noutcome. \n \nGastrointestinal haemorrhages, including rectal bleeding and melaena have been reported in colorectal \ncancer patients, and have been assessed as tumour-associated haemorrhages. \n \nTumour-associated haemorrhage was also seen rarely in other tumour types and locations, including \ncases of central nervous system (CNS) bleeding in patients with CNS metastases (see section 4.4). \n \nThe incidence of CNS bleeding in patients with untreated CNS metastases receiving bevacizumab has \nnot been prospectively evaluated in randomised clinical trials. In an exploratory retrospective analysis \nof data from 13 completed randomised trials in patients with various tumour types, 3 patients out of 91 \n(3.3%) with brain metastases experienced CNS bleeding (all Grade 4) when treated with bevacizumab, \ncompared to 1 case (Grade 5) out of 96 patients (1%) that were not exposed to bevacizumab. In two \nsubsequent studies in patients with treated brain metastases (which included around 800 patients), one \ncase of Grade 2 CNS haemorrhage was reported in 83 subjects treated with bevacizumab (1.2%) at the \ntime of interim safety analysis (NCI-CTCAE v.3). \n \nAcross all clinical trials, mucocutaneous haemorrhage has been seen in up to 50% of bevacizumab- \ntreated patients. These were most commonly NCI-CTCAE v.3 Grade 1 epistaxis that lasted less than \n5 minutes, resolved without medical intervention and did not require any changes in the bevacizumab \ntreatment regimen. Clinical safety data suggest that the incidence of minor mucocutaneous \nhaemorrhage (e.g. epistaxis) may be dose-dependent. \n \nThere have also been less common reactions of minor mucocutaneous haemorrhage in other locations, \nsuch as gingival bleeding or vaginal bleeding. \n19 \n \nThromboembolism (see section 4.4) \n \nArterial thromboembolism \nAn increased incidence of arterial thromboembolic reactions was observed in patients treated with \nbevacizumab across indications, including cerebrovascular accidents, myocardial infarction, transient \nischaemic attacks, and other arterial thromboembolic reactions. \n \nIn clinical trials, the overall incidence of arterial thromboembolic reactions ranged up to 3.8% in the \nbevacizumab containing arms compared with up to 2.1% in the chemotherapy control arms. Fatal \noutcome was reported in 0.8% of patients receiving bevacizumab compared to 0.5% in patients \nreceiving chemotherapy alone. Cerebrovascular accidents (including transient ischaemic attacks) were \nreported in up to 2.7% of patients treated with bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy \ncompared to up to 0.5% of patients treated with chemotherapy alone. Myocardial infarction was \nreported in up to 1.4% of patients treated with bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy \ncompared to up to 0.7% of patients treated with chemotherapy alone. \n \nIn one clinical trial evaluating bevacizumab in combination with 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid, \nAVF2192g, patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who were not candidates for treatment with \nirinotecan were included. In this trial arterial thromboembolic reactions were observed in 11% \n(11/100) of patients compared to 5.8% (6/104) in the chemotherapy control group. \n \nVenous thromboembolism \nThe incidence of venous thromboembolic reactions in clinical trials was similar in patients receiving \nbevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy compared to those receiving the control \nchemotherapy alone. Venous thromboembolic reactions include deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary \nembolism and thrombophlebitis. \n \nIn clinical trials across indications, the overall incidence of venous thromboembolic reactions ranged \nfrom 2.8% to 17.3% of bevacizumab-treated patients compared with 3.2% to 15.6% in the control \narms. \n \nGrade 3-5 (NCI-CTCAE v.3) venous thromboembolic reactions have been reported in up to 7.8% of \npatients treated with chemotherapy plus bevacizumab compared with up to 4.9% in patients treated \nwith chemotherapy alone (across indications, excluding persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical \ncancer). \n \nFrom a clinical trial in patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer (study \nGOG-0240), grade 3-5 venous thromboembolic events have been reported in up to 15.6% of patients \ntreated with bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel and cisplatin compared with up to 7.0% of \npatients treated with paclitaxel and cisplatin. \n \nPatients who have experienced a venous thromboembolic reaction may be at higher risk for a \nrecurrence if they receive bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy \nalone. \n \nCongestive heart failure (CHF) \nIn clinical trials with bevacizumab, congestive heart failure (CHF) was observed in all cancer \nindications studied to date, but occurred predominantly in patients with metastatic breast cancer. In \nfour phase III trials (AVF2119g, E2100, BO17708 and AVF3694g) in patients with metastatic breast \ncancer CHF Grade 3 (NCI-CTCAE v.3) or higher was reported in up to 3.5% of patients treated with \nbevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy compared with up to 0.9% in the control arms. For \npatients in study AVF3694g who received anthracyclines concomitantly with bevacizumab, the \nincidences of Grade 3 or higher CHF for the respective bevacizumab and control arms were similar to \nthose in the other studies in metastatic breast cancer: 2.9% in the anthracycline + bevacizumab arm \nand 0% in the anthracycline + placebo arm. In addition, in study AVF3694g the incidences of all \nGrade CHF were similar between the anthracycline + bevacizumab (6.2%) and the \nanthracycline + placebo arms (6.0%). \n20 \n \nMost patients who developed CHF during mBC trials showed improved symptoms and/or left \nventricular function following appropriate medical therapy. \n \nIn most clinical trials of bevacizumab, patients with pre-existing CHF of NYHA (New York Heart \nAssociation) II-IV were excluded, therefore, no information is available on the risk of CHF in this \npopulation. \n \nPrior anthracyclines exposure and/or prior radiation to the chest wall may be possible risk factors for \nthe development of CHF. \n \nAn increased incidence of CHF has been observed in a clinical trial of patients with diffuse large \nB-cell lymphoma when receiving bevacizumab with a cumulative doxorubicin dose greater than \n300 mg/m2. This phase III clinical trial compared \nrituximab/cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine/prednisone (R-CHOP) plus bevacizumab to \nR-CHOP without bevacizumab. While the incidence of CHF was, in both arms, above that previously \nobserved for doxorubicin therapy, the rate was higher in the R-CHOP plus bevacizumab arm. These \nresults suggest that close clinical observation with appropriate cardiac assessments should be \nconsidered for patients exposed to cumulative doxorubicin doses greater than 300 mg/m2 when \ncombined with bevacizumab. \n \nHypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylactic shock)/infusion reactions (see section 4.4 and Post- \nmarketing experience below) \nIn some clinical trials anaphylactic and anaphylactoid-type reactions were reported more frequently in \npatients receiving bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy than with chemotherapy alone. The \nincidence of these reactions in some clinical trials of bevacizumab is common (up to 5% in \nbevacizumab-treated patients). \n \nInfections \nFrom a clinical trial in patients with persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer (study \nGOG-0240), grade 3-5 infections have been reported in up to 24% of patients treated with \nbevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel and topotecan compared with up to 13% of patients \ntreated with paclitaxel and topotecan. \n \nOvarian failure/fertility (see sections 4.4 and 4.6) \nIn NSABP C-08, a phase III trial of bevacizumab in adjuvant treatment of patients with colon cancer, \nthe incidence of new cases of ovarian failure, defined as amenorrhoea lasting 3 or more months, FSH \nlevel \u2265 30 mIU/mL and a negative serum \u03b2-HCG pregnancy test, has been evaluated in 295 \npremenopausal women. New cases of ovarian failure were reported in 2.6% patients in the \nmFOLFOX-6 group compared to 39% in the mFOLFOX-6 + bevacizumab group. After \ndiscontinuation of bevacizumab treatment, ovarian function recovered in 86.2% of these evaluable \nwomen. Long term effects of the treatment with bevacizumab on fertility are unknown. \n \nLaboratory abnormalities \nDecreased neutrophil count, decreased white blood cell count and presence of urine protein may be \nassociated with bevacizumab treatment. \n \nAcross clinical trials, the following Grade 3 and 4 (NCI-CTCAE v.3) laboratory abnormalities \noccurred in patients treated with bevacizumab with at least a 2% difference compared to the \ncorresponding control groups: hyperglycaemia, decreased haemoglobin, hypokalaemia, \nhyponatraemia, decreased white blood cell count, increased international normalised ratio (INR). \n \nClinical trials have shown that transient increases in serum creatinine (ranging between 1.5-1.9 times \nbaseline level), both with and without proteinuria, are associated with the use of bevacizumab. The \nobserved increase in serum creatinine was not associated with a higher incidence of clinical \nmanifestations of renal impairment in patients treated with bevacizumab. \n21 \n \nOther special populations \n \nElderly \nIn randomised clinical trials, age > 65 years was associated with an increased risk of developing \narterial thromboembolic reactions, including cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), transient ischaemic \nattacks (TIAs) and myocardial infarctions (MIs). Other reactions with a higher frequency seen in \npatients over 65 were Grade 3-4 leucopenia and thrombocytopenia (NCI-CTCAE v.3); and all Grade \nneutropenia, diarrhoea, nausea, headache and fatigue as compared to those aged \u2264 65 years when \ntreated with bevacizumab (see sections 4.4 and 4.8 under Thromboembolism).

population). \n4 In some patients previously exposed to capecitabine. \n \nDescription of selected adverse reactions \n \nThis section contains the most common and clinically relevant adverse reactions related to Abraxane. \n \nAdverse reactions were assessed in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated with \n260 mg/m2 Abraxane once every three weeks in the pivotal phase III clinical study (Abraxane \nmonotherapy). \n \nAdverse reactions were assessed in 421 patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who were treated \nwith Abraxane in combination with gemcitabine (125 mg/m2 Abraxane in combination with \ngemcitabine at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 given on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28-day cycle) and \n402 gemcitabine monotherapy-treated patients receiving first-line systemic treatment for metastatic \nadenocarcinoma of the pancreas (Abraxane/gemcitabine). \n \nAdverse reactions were assessed in 514 patients with non-small cell lung cancer who were treated with \nAbraxane in combination with carboplatin (100 mg/m2 Abraxane given on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each \n21-day cycle in combination with carboplatin given on Day 1 of each cycle) in the phase III \nrandomized, controlled clinical trial (Abraxane/carboplatin). Patient-reported taxane toxicity was \nassessed using the 4 subscales of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-Taxane \nquestionnaire. Using repeated measure analysis, 3 of the 4 subscales (peripheral neuropathy, pain \nhands/feet and hearing) favored Abraxane and carboplatin (p \u2264 0.002). For the other subscale \n(oedema), there was no difference in the treatment arms. \n \nInfections and infestations \n \nAbraxane/gemcitabine \nSepsis was reported at a rate of 5% in patients with or without neutropenia who received Abraxane in \ncombination with gemcitabine during the conduct of a trial in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Of the \n15 \n22 cases of sepsis reported in patients treated with Abraxane in combination with gemcitabine, 5 had a \nfatal outcome. Complications due to the underlying pancreatic cancer, especially biliary obstruction or \npresence of biliary stent, were identified as significant contributing factors. If a patient becomes febrile \n(regardless of neutrophil count), initiate treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics. For febrile \nneutropenia, withhold Abraxane and gemcitabine until fever resolves and ANC \u2265 1500 cells/mm3, then \nresume treatment at reduced dose levels (see section 4.2). \n \nBlood and lymphatic system disorders \n \nAbraxane monotherapy-metastatic breast cancer \nIn patients with metastatic breast cancer, neutropenia was the most notable important haematological \ntoxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was rapidly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was \nreported in 71% of patients. Grade 4 neutropenia (< 500 cells/mm3) occurred in 9% of patients treated \nwith Abraxane. Febrile neutropenia occurred in four patients on Abraxane. Anaemia (Hb < 10 g/dl) \nwas observed in 46% of patients on Abraxane and was severe (Hb < 8 g/dl) in three cases. \nLymphopenia was observed in 45% of the patients. \n \nAbraxane/gemcitabine \nTable 7 provides the frequency and severity of haematologic laboratory-detected abnormalities for \npatients treated with Abraxane in combination with gemcitabine or with gemcitabine. \n \nTable 7: Haematologic laboratory-detected abnormalities in pancreatic adenocarcinoma trial \n \nAbraxane (125 mg/m2)/ \nGemcitabine \nGemcitabine \nGrades 1-4 \n(%) \nGrade 3-4 \n(%) \nGrades 1-4 \n(%) \nGrade 3-4 \n(%) \nAnaemiaa,b \n97 \n13 \n96 \n12 \nNeutropenia a,b \n73 \n38 \n58 \n27 \nThrombocytopeniab,c \n74 \n13 \n70 \n9 \na 405 patients assessed in Abraxane/gemcitabine-treated group \nb 388 patients assessed in gemcitabine-treated group \nc 404 patients assessed in Abraxane/gemcitabine-treated group \n \nAbraxane/carboplatin \nAnaemia and thrombocytopenia were more commonly reported in the Abraxane and carboplatin arm \nthan in the Taxol and carboplatin arm (54% versus 28% and 45% versus 27% respectively). \n \nNervous system disorders \n \nAbraxane monotherapy-metastatic breast cancer \nIn general, the frequency and severity of neurotoxicity was dose-dependent in patients receiving \nAbraxane. Peripheral neuropathy (mostly Grade 1 or 2 sensory neuropathy) was observed in 68% of \npatients on Abraxane with 10% being Grade 3, and no cases of Grade 4. \n \nAbraxane/gemcitabine \nFor patients treated with Abraxane in combination with gemcitabine, the median time to first \noccurrence of Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy was 140 days. The median time to improvement by at \nleast 1 grade was 21 days, and the median time to improvement from Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy to \nGrade 0 or 1 was 29 days. Of the patients with treatment interrupted due to peripheral neuropathy, \n44% (31/70 patients) were able to resume Abraxane at a reduced dose. No patients treated with \nAbraxane in combination with gemcitabine had Grade 4 peripheral neuropathy. \n \nAbraxane/carboplatin \nFor non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with Abraxane and carboplatin, the median time to first \noccurrence of Grade 3 treatment-related peripheral neuropathy was 121 days, and the median time to \n16 \nimprovement from Grade 3 treatment related peripheral neuropathy to Grade 1 was 38 days. No \npatients treated with Abraxane and carboplatin experienced Grade 4 peripheral neuropathy. \n \nEye disorders \nThere have been rare reports during post-marketing surveillance of reduced visual acuity due to \ncystoid macular oedema during treatment with Abraxane (see section 4.4). \n \nRespiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders \n \nAbraxane/gemcitabine \nPneumonitis has been reported at a rate of 4% with the use of Abraxane in combination with \ngemcitabine. Of the 17 cases of pneumonitis reported in patients treated with Abraxane in combination \nwith gemcitabine, 2 had a fatal outcome. Monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of \npneumonitis. After ruling out infectious etiology and upon making a diagnosis of pneumonitis, \npermanently discontinue treatment with Abraxane and gemcitabine and promptly initiate appropriate \ntreatment and supportive measures (see section 4.2). \n \nGastrointestinal disorders \n \nAbraxane monotherapy-metastatic breast cancer \nNausea occurred in 29% of the patients and diarrhoea in 25% of the patients. \n \nSkin and subcutaneous tissue disorders \n \nAbraxane monotherapy-metastatic breast cancer \nAlopecia was observed in > 80% of the patients treated with Abraxane. The majority of alopecia \nevents occurred less than one month after initiation of Abraxane. Pronounced hair loss \u2265 50% is \nexpected for the majority of patients who experience alopecia. \n \nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders \n \nAbraxane monotherapy-metastatic breast cancer \nArthralgia occurred in 32% of patients on Abraxane and was severe in 6% of cases. Myalgia occurred \nin 24% of patients on Abraxane and was severe in 7% of cases. The symptoms were usually transient, \ntypically occurred three days after Abraxane administration and resolved within a week. \n \nGeneral disorders and administration site conditions \n \nAbraxane monotherapy-metastatic breast cancer \nAsthenia/Fatigue was reported in 40% of the patients. \n \nPaediatric population \n \nThe study consisted of 106 patients, 104 of whom were paediatric patients aged from 6 months to less \nthan 18 years (see section 5.1). Every patient experienced at least 1 adverse reaction. The most \nfrequently reported adverse reactions were neutropenia, anaemia, leukopenia and pyrexia. Serious \nadverse reactions reported in more than 2 patients were pyrexia, back pain, peripheral oedema and \nvomiting. No new safety signals were identified in the limited number of paediatric patients treated \nwith Abraxane and the safety profile was similar to that of the adult population. \n \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.

Physicians should use caution when prescribing filgrastim in \npatients with sickle cell trait or sickle cell disease.  \n \nOsteoporosis \nMonitoring of bone density may be indicated in patients with underlying osteoporotic bone diseases \nwho undergo continuous therapy with filgrastim for more than 6 months. \n \nSpecial precautions in cancer patients \n \nFilgrastim should not be used to increase the dose of cytotoxic chemotherapy beyond established \ndosage regimens. \n \nRisks associated with increased doses of chemotherapy \nSpecial caution should be used when treating patients with high dose chemotherapy because improved \ntumour outcome has not been demonstrated and intensified doses of chemotherapeutic agents may \nlead to increased toxicities including cardiac, pulmonary, neurologic and dermatologic effects (please \nrefer to the prescribing information of the specific chemotherapy agents used). \n \nEffect of chemotherapy on erythrocytes and thrombocytes \nTreatment with filgrastim alone does not preclude thrombocytopenia and anaemia due to \nmyelosuppressive chemotherapy. Because of the potential of receiving higher doses of chemotherapy \n(e.g. full doses on the prescribed schedule) the patient may be at greater risk of thrombocytopenia and \nanaemia. Regular monitoring of platelet count and haematocrit is recommended. Special care should \nbe taken when administering single or combination chemotherapeutic agents which are known to \ncause severe thrombocytopenia. \n \nThe use of filgrastim-mobilised PBPCs has been shown to reduce the depth and duration of \nthrombocytopenia following myelosuppressive or myeloablative chemotherapy. \n \nMyelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia in breast and lung cancer patients \nIn the post-marketing observational study setting, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute \nmyeloid leukaemia (AML) have been associated with the use of pegfilgrastim, an alternative G-CSF \nmedicine, in conjunction with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy in breast and lung cancer patients. A \nsimilar association between filgrastim and MDS/AML has not been observed. Nonetheless, patients \nwith breast cancer and patients with lung cancer should be monitored for signs and symptoms of  \nMDS/AML. \n \n8 \nOther special precautions \nThe effects of filgrastim in patients with substantially reduced myeloid progenitors have not been \nstudied. Filgrastim acts primarily on neutrophil precursors to exert its effect in elevating neutrophil \ncounts. Therefore, in patients with reduced precursors, neutrophil response may be diminished (such \nas those treated with extensive radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or those with bone marrow infiltration \nby tumour). \n \nVascular disorders, including veno-occlusive disease and fluid volume disturbances, have been \nreported occasionally in patients undergoing high dose chemotherapy followed by transplantation. \n \nThere have been reports of graft versus host disease (GvHD) and fatalities in patients receiving G-CSF \nafter allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (see section 4.8 and 5.1). \n \nIncreased haematopoietic activity of the bone marrow in response to growth factor therapy has been \nassociated with transient abnormal bone scans. This should be considered when interpreting bone-\nimaging results. \n \nSpecial precautions in patients undergoing PBPC mobilization \n \nMobilisation \nThere are no prospectively randomised comparisons of the two recommended mobilisation methods \n(filgrastim alone, or in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy) within the same patient \npopulation. The degree of variation between individual patients and between laboratory assays of \nCD34+ cells mean that direct comparison between different studies is difficult. It is therefore difficult \nto recommend an optimum method. The choice of mobilisation method should be considered in \nrelation to the overall objectives of treatment for an individual patient.  \n \nPrior exposure to cytotoxic agents \nPatients who have undergone very extensive prior myelosuppressive therapy may not show sufficient \nmobilisation of PBPC to achieve the recommended minimum yield (\u22652.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg) or \nacceleration of platelet recovery to the same degree. \n \nSome cytotoxic agents exhibit particular toxicities to the haematopoietic progenitor pool and may \nadversely affect progenitor mobilisation. Agents such as melphalan, carmustine (BCNU) and \ncarboplatin, when administered over prolonged periods prior to attempts at progenitor mobilisation, \nmay reduce progenitor yield. However, the administration of melphalan, carboplatin or carmustine \n(BCNU) together with filgrastim has been shown to be effective for progenitor mobilisation. When \nPBPC transplantation is envisaged it is advisable to plan the stem cell mobilization procedure early in \nthe treatment course of the patient. Particular attention should be paid to the number of progenitors \nmobilised in such patients before the administration of high-dose chemotherapy. If yields are \ninadequate, as measured by the criteria above, alternative forms of treatment, not requiring progenitor \nsupport should be considered. \n \nAssessment of progenitor cell yields \nIn assessing the number of progenitor cells harvested in patients treated with filgrastim, particular \nattention should be paid to the method of quantitation. The results of flow cytometric analysis of \nCD34+ cell numbers vary depending on the precise methodology used and recommendations of \nnumbers based on studies in other laboratories need to be interpreted with caution. \n \nStatistical analysis of the relationship between the number of CD34+ cells re-infused and the rate of \nplatelet recovery after high-dose chemotherapy indicates a complex but continuous relationship. \n \nThe recommendation of a minimum yields of \u2265 2.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg is based on published \nexperience resulting in adequate haematologic reconstitution. Yields in excess of this appear to \ncorrelate with more rapid recovery, those below with slower recovery. \n \nSpecial precautions in normal donors undergoing PBPC mobilization \n9 \n \nMobilisation of PBPC does not provide a direct clinical benefit to normal donors and should only be \nconsidered for the purposes of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. \n \nPBPC mobilisation should be considered only in donors who meet normal clinical and laboratory \neligibility criteria for stem cell donation with special attention to haematological values and infectious \ndiseases.  \n \nThe safety and efficacy of filgrastim has not been assessed in normal donors less than 16 years or \ngreater than 60 years.  \n \nTransient thrombocytopenia (platelets < 100 x 109/L) following filgrastim administration and \nleukapheresis was observed in 35% of subjects studied. Among these, two cases of platelets < 50 x \n109/L were reported and attributed to the leukapheresis procedure.  \n \nIf more than one leukapheresis is required, particular attention should be paid to donors with platelets \n< 100 x 109/L prior to leukapheresis; in general apheresis should not be performed if platelets < 75 x \n109/L.  \n \nLeukapheresis should not be performed in donors who are anticoagulated or who have known defects \nin haemostasis. Donors who receive G-CSFs for PBPC mobilisation should be monitored until \nhaematological indices return to normal.  \n \nSpecial precautions in recipients of allogeneic PBPCs mobilised with filgrastim \n \nCurrent data indicate that immunological interactions between the allogeneic PBPC graft and the \nrecipient may be associated with an increased risk of acute and chronic GvHD when compared with \nbone marrow transplantation. \n \nSpecial precautions in SCN patients \n \nFilgrastim should not be administered to patients with severe congenital neutropenia who develop \nleukaemia or have evidence of leukaemic evolution. \n \nBlood cell counts \nOther blood cell changes occur, including anaemia and transient increases in myeloid progenitors, \nwhich require close monitoring of cell counts. \n \nTransformation to leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome \nSpecial care should be taken in the diagnosis of SCNs to distinguish them from other haematopoietic \ndisorders such as aplastic anaemia, myelodysplasia and myeloid leukaemia. Complete blood cell \ncounts with differential and platelet counts and an evaluation of bone marrow morphology and \nkaryotype should be performed prior to treatment. \n \nThere was a low frequency (approximately 3%) of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or leukaemia in \nclinical trial patients with SCN treated with filgrastim. This observation has only been made in \npatients with congenital neutropenia. MDS and leukaemias are natural complications of the disease \nand are of uncertain relation to filgrastim therapy. A subset of approximately 12% of patients who had \nnormal cytogenetic evaluations at baseline were subsequently found to have abnormalities, including \nmonosomy 7, on routine repeat evaluation. It is currently unclear whether long-term treatment of \npatients with SCN will predispose patients to cytogenetic abnormalities, MDS or leukaemic \ntransformation. It is recommended to perform morphologic and cytogenetic bone marrow \nexaminations in patients at regular intervals (approximately every 12 months). \n \nOther special precautions \nCauses of transient neutropenia such as viral infections should be excluded. \n \n10 \nHaematuria was common and proteinuria occurred in a small number of patients. Regular urinalysis \nshould be performed to monitor these event. \n \nThe safety and efficacy in neonates and patients with autoimmune neutropenia have not been \nestablished. \n \nSpecial precautions in patients with HIV infection \n \nBlood cell counts \nAbsolute neutrophil count (ANC) should be monitored closely, especially during the first few weeks \nof filgrastim therapy. Some patients may respond very rapidly and with a considerable increase in \nneutrophil count to the initial dose of filgrastim. It is recommended that the ANC is measured daily for \nthe first 2 to 3 days of filgrastim administration. Thereafter, it is recommended that the ANC is \nmeasured at least twice weekly for the first two weeks and subsequently once per week or once every \nother week during maintenance therapy. During intermittent dosing with 30 MU (300 microgram)/day \nof filgrastim, there can be wide fluctuations in the patient's ANC over time. In order to determine a \npatient's trough or nadir ANC, it is recommended that blood samples are taken for ANC measurement \nimmediately prior to any scheduled dosing with filgrastim. \n \nRisk associated with increased doses of myelosuppressive medicinal products \nTreatment with filgrastim alone does not preclude thrombocytopenia and anaemia due to \nmyelosuppressive medicinal products. As a result of the potential to receive higher doses or a greater \nnumber of these medicinal products with filgrastim therapy, the patient may be at higher risk of \ndeveloping thrombocytopenia and anaemia. Regular monitoring of blood counts is recommended (see \nabove). \n \nInfections and malignancies causing myelosuppression \nNeutropenia may be due to bone marrow infiltrating opportunistic infections such as Mycobacterium \navium complex or malignancies such as lymphoma. In patients with known bone marrow-infiltrating \ninfections or malignancy, consider appropriate therapy for treatment of the underlying condition in \naddition to administration of filgrastim for treatment of neutropenia. The effects of filgrastim on \nneutropenia due to bone marrow-infiltrating infection or malignancy have not been well established. \n \nAll patients \nAccofil contains sorbitol (E420). Patients with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) must not be given \nthis medicine unless strictly necessary. \nBabies and young children (below 2 years of age) may not yet be diagnosed with hereditary fructose \nintolerance (HFI). Medicines (containing sorbitol/fructose) given intravenously may be life-\nthreatening and should be contraindicated in this population unless there is an overwhelming clinical \nneed and no alternatives are available. \n \nA detailed history with regard to HFI symptoms has to be taken of each patient prior to being given \nthis medicinal product. \n \nAccofil contains less than 1mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, that is to say essentially \u2018sodium-free\u2019.  \n \nThe needle cover of the pre-filled syringe contains dry natural rubber (a derivative of latex), which \nmay cause severe allergic reactions. \n \n \n4.5 \nInteraction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction \n \nThe safety and efficacy of filgrastim given on the same day as myelosuppressive cytotoxic \nchemotherapy have not been definitively established. In view of the sensitivity of rapidly dividing \nmyeloid cells to myelosuppressive cytotoxic chemotherapy, the use of filgrastim is not recommended \nin the period from 24 hours before to 24 hours after chemotherapy. Preliminary evidence from a small \nnumber of patients treated concomitantly with filgrastim and 5-Fluorouracil indicates that the severity \n11 \nof neutropenia may be exacerbated. \n \nPossible interactions with other haematopoietic growth factors and cytokines have not yet been \ninvestigated in clinical trials. \n \nSince lithium promotes the release of neutrophils, it is likely to potentiate the effect of filgrastim. \nAlthough this interaction has not been formally investigated, there is no evidence that such an \ninteraction is harmful. \n \n4.6 \nFertility, pregnancy and lactation \n \nPregnancy \n \nThere are no or limited amount of data from the use of filgrastim in pregnant women. Studies in \nanimals have shown reproductive toxicity. An increased incidence of embryo-loss has been observed \nin rabbits at high multiples of the clinical exposure and in the presence of maternal toxicity (see \nsection 5.3). There are reports in the literature where the transplacental passage of filgrastim in \npregnant women has been demonstrated.  \n \nFilgrastim is not recommended during pregnancy. \n \nBreast-feeding \n \nIt is unknown whether filgrastim/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants \ncannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to \ndiscontinue/abstain from filgrastim therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child \nand the benefit of therapy for the woman. \n \nFertility \n \nFilgrastim did not affect reproductive performance or fertility in male or female rats (see section 5.3).  \n \n4.7 \nEffects on ability to drive and use machines \n \nAccofil may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  \n \nDizziness may occur following the administration of Accofil (see section 4.8). \n \n4.8 \nUndesirable effects \n \nSummary of the safety profile  \n \nThe most serious adverse reactions that may occur during Filgrastim treatment include: anaphylactic \nreaction, serious pulmonary adverse events (including interstitial pneumonia and ARDS), capillary \nleak syndrome, severe splenomegaly/splenic rupture, transformation to myelodysplastic syndrome or \nleukaemia in SCN patients, GvHD in patients receiving allogeneic bone marrow transfer or peripheral \nblood cell progenitor cell transplant and sickle cell crisis in patients with sickle cell disease. \n  \nThe most commonly reported adverse reactions are pyrexia, musculoskeletal pain (which includes \nbone pain, back pain, arthralgia, myalgia, pain in extremity, musculoskeletal pain, musculoskeletal \nchest pain, neck pain), anaemia, vomiting, and nausea. In clinical trials in cancer patients \nmusculoskeletal pain was mild or moderate in 10%, and severe in 3% of patients. \n \nTabulated summary of adverse reactions \n \nThe data in the tables below describe adverse reactions reported from clinical trials and spontaneous \nreporting.

reports of GvHD and fatalities in patients receiving G-CSF after allogeneic bone \nmarrow transplantation (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). \n \nCapillary leak syndrome \nCases of capillary leak syndrome have been reported with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor use. \nThese have generally occurred in patients with advanced malignant diseases, sepsis, taking multiple \nchemotherapy medications or undergoing apheresis (see section 4.4). \n \nSweets syndrome \nCases of Sweets syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) have been reported in  patients \ntreated with filgrastim.  \n \nPulmonary adverse events \nIn clinical studies and the post-marketing setting pulmonary adverse effects including interstitial lung \ndisease, pulmonary oedema, and lung infiltration have been reported in some cases with an outcome of \nrespiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which may be fatal (see section 4.4)  \n \nSplenomegaly and Splenic rupture \nCases of splenomegaly and splenic rupture have been reported following administration of filgrastim. \nSome cases of splenic rupture were fatal (see section 4.4). \n \nHypersensitivity \nHypersensitivity-type reactions including anaphylaxis, rash, urticaria, angioedema, dyspnoea and \nhypotension occurring on initial or subsequent treatment have been reported in clinical studies and in \npost-marketing experience. Overall, reports were more common after IV administration. In some \ncases, symptoms have recurred with rechallenge, suggesting a causal relationship. Filgrastim should \nbe permanently discontinued in patients who experience a serious allergic reaction.  \n \nCutaneous vasculitis \nCutaneous vasculitis has been reported in patients treated with Filgrastim. The mechanism of \nvasculitis in patients receiving Filgrastim is unknown. During long term use cutaneous vasculitis has \nbeen reported in 2% of SCN patients. \n \nPseudogout (chondrocalcinosis pyrophosphate) \nPseudogout (chondrocalcinosis pyrophosphate) has been reported in cancer patients treated with \nfilgrastim. \n \nLeukocytosis \nLeukocytosis (WBC > 50 x 109/L) was observed in 41% of normal donors and transient \nthrombocytopenia (platelets < 100 x 109/L) following filgrastim and leukapheresis was observed in \n35% of donors (see section 4.4).  \n \n15 \nPaediatric population  \n \nData from clinical studies in paediatric patients indicate that the safety and efficacy of filgrastim are \nsimilar in both adults and children receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy suggesting no age-related \ndifferences in the pharmacokinetics of filgrastim. The only consistently reported adverse event was \nmusculoskeletal pain, which is no different from the experience in the adult population. \n \nThere is insufficient data to further evaluate filgrastim use in paediatric subjects. \n \nOther special populations  \n \nGeriatric use \nNo overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between subjects over 65 years of age \ncompared to younger adult (>18 years of age) subjects receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy and clinical \nexperience has not identified differences in the responses between elderly and younger adult patients. \nThere are insufficient data to evaluate Accofil use in geriatric subjects for other approved Accofil \nindications.  \n \nPaediatric SCN patients \nCases of decreased bone density and osteoporosis have been reported in paediatric patients with severe \nchronic neutropenia receiving chronic treatment with filgrastim.  \n  \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.

The rate of atrial fibrillation serious adverse events was increased in patients \nreceiving Aclasta (1.3%) (51 out of 3,862) compared with patients receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 out of \n3,852). The mechanism behind the increased incidence of atrial fibrillation is unknown. In the \nosteoporosis trials (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]) the pooled atrial fibrillation \nincidences were comparable between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%). For atrial fibrillation serious \nadverse events the pooled incidences were 1.3% for Aclasta and 0.8% for placebo. \n \n9 \nClass effects \nRenal impairment \nZoledronic acid has been associated with renal impairment manifested as deterioration in renal \nfunction (i.e. increased serum creatinine) and in rare cases acute renal failure. Renal impairment has \nbeen observed following the administration of zoledronic acid, especially in patients with pre-existing \nrenal dysfunction or additional risk factors (e.g advanced age, oncology patients with chemotherapy, \nconcomitant nephrotoxic medicinal products, concomitant diuretic therapy, severe dehydration), with \nthe majority of them receiving a 4 mg dose every 3\u20134 weeks, but it has been observed in patients after \na single administration. \n \nIn clinical trials in osteoporosis, the change in creatinine clearance (measured annually prior to dosing) \nand the incidence of renal failure and impairment was comparable for both the Aclasta and placebo \ntreatment groups over three years. There was a transient increase in serum creatinine observed within \n10 days in 1.8% of Aclasta-treated patients versus 0.8% of placebo-treated patients. \n \nHypocalcaemia \nIn clinical trials in osteoporosis, approximately 0.2% of patients had notable declines of serum calcium \nlevels (less than 1.87 mmol/l) following Aclasta administration. No symptomatic cases of \nhypocalcaemia were observed. \n \nIn the Paget\u2019s disease trials, symptomatic hypocalcaemia was observed in approximately 1% of \npatients, in all of whom it resolved. \n \nBased on laboratory assessment, transient asymptomatic calcium levels below the normal reference \nrange (less than 2.10 mmol/l) occurred in 2.3% of Aclasta-treated patients in a large clinical trial \ncompared to 21% of Aclasta-treated patients in the Paget\u2019s disease trials. The frequency of \nhypocalcaemia was much lower following subsequent infusions. \n \nAll patients received adequate supplementation with vitamin D and calcium in the post-menopausal \nosteoporosis trial, the prevention of clinical fractures after hip fracture trial, and the Paget\u2019s disease \ntrials (see also section 4.2). In the trial for the prevention of clinical fractures following a recent hip \nfracture, vitamin D levels were not routinely measured but the majority of patients received a loading \ndose of vitamin D prior to Aclasta administration (see section 4.2). \n \nLocal reactions \nIn a large clinical trial, local reactions at the infusion site, such as redness, swelling and/or pain, were \nreported (0.7%) following the administration of zoledronic acid. \n \nOsteonecrosis of the jaw \nCases of osteonecrosis of the jaw have been reported, predominantly in cancer patients treated with \nmedicinal products that inhibit bone resorption, including zoledronic acid (see section 4.4). In a large \nclinical trial in 7,736 patients, osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported in one patient treated with \nAclasta and one patient treated with placebo. Cases of ONJ have been reported in the post-marketing \nsetting for Aclasta. \n \nAcute phase reactions \nThe overall percentage of patients who reported acute phase reactions or post-dose symptoms \n(including serious cases) after Aclasta administration is as follows (frequencies derived from the study \nin treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis): fever (18.1%), myalgia (9.4%), flu-like symptoms \n(7.8%), arthralgia (6.8%) and headache (6.5%), the majority of which occurred within the first 3 days \nfollowing Aclasta administration. The majority of these symptoms were mild to moderate in nature \nand resolved within 3 days of the event onset. The incidence of these symptoms decreased with \nsubsequent annual doses of Aclasta. The percentage of patients who experienced adverse reactions \nwas lower in a smaller study (19.5%, 10.4%, 10.7% after the first, second and third infusion, \nrespectively), where prophylaxis against adverse reactions was used (see section 4.4). \n \n10 \nReporting of suspected adverse reactions \n \nReporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It \nallows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare \nprofessionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system \nlisted in Appendix V. \n \n4.9 \n"
