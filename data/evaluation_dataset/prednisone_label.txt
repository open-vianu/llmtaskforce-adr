ADVERSE REACTIONS
(listed alphabetically, under each subsection)
The following adverse reactions have been reported with prednisone or other
corticosteroids:
Allergic Reactions
anaphylactoid or hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylaxis, angioedema.
Cardiovascular System
bradycardia, cardiac arrest, cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac enlargement, circulatory
collapse, congestive heart failure, ECG changes caused by potassium deficiency, edema,
fat embolism, hypertension or aggravation of hypertension, hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy in premature infants, myocardial rupture following recent myocardial
infarction (see WARNINGS: Cardio-Renal), necrotizing angiitis, pulmonary edema,
syncope, tachycardia, thromboembolism, thrombophlebitis, vasculitis.
Dermatologic
acne, acneiform eruptions, allergic dermatitis, alopecia, angioedema, angioneurotic
edema, atrophy and thinning of skin, dry scaly skin, ecchymoses and petechiae
(bruising), erythema, facial edema, hirsutism, impaired wound healing, increased
sweating, Karposiâ€™s sarcoma (see PRECAUTIONS: General Precautions), lupus
erythematosus-like lesions, perineal irritation, purpura, rash, striae, subcutaneous fat
atrophy, suppression of reactions to skin tests, striae, telangiectasis, thin fragile skin,
thinning scalp hair, urticaria.
Endocrine
Adrenal insufficiency-greatest potential caused by high potency glucocorticoids with long
duration of action (associated symptoms include; arthralgias, buffalo hump, dizziness,
life-threatening hypotension, nausea, severe tiredness or weakness), amenorrhea,
postmenopausal bleeding or other menstrual irregularities, decreased carbohydrate and
glucose tolerance, development of cushingoid state, diabetes mellitus (new onset or
manifestations of latent), glycosuria, hyperglycemia, hypertrichosis, hyperthyroidism
(see WARNINGS: Endocrine), hypothyroidism, increased requirements for insulin or
oral hypoglycemic agents in diabetics, lipids abnormal, moon face, negative nitrogen
balance caused by protein catabolism, secondary adrenocortical and pituitary
unresponsiveness (particularly in times of stress, as in trauma, surgery or illness) (see
WARNINGS: Endocrine), suppression of growth in pediatric patients.
Fluid and Electrolyte Disturbances
congestive heart failure in susceptible patients, fluid retention, hypokalemia, hypokalemic
alkalosis, metabolic alkalosis, hypotension or shock-like reaction, potassium loss, sodium
retention with resulting edema.
Gastrointestinal
abdominal distention, abdominal pain, anorexia which may result in weight loss,
constipation, diarrhea, elevation in serum liver enzyme levels (usually reversible upon
discontinuation), gastric irritation, hepatomegaly, increased appetite and weight gain,
nausea, oropharyngeal candidiasis, pancreatitis, peptic ulcer with possible perforation
and hemorrhage, perforation of the small and large intestine (particularly in patients with
inflammatory bowel disease), ulcerative esophagitis, vomiting.
Hematologic
anemia, neutropenia (including febrile neutropenia).
Metabolic
negative nitrogen balance due to protein catabolism.
Musculoskeletal
arthralgias, aseptic necrosis of femoral and humeral heads, increase risk of fracture,
loss of muscle mass, muscle weakness, myalgias, osteopenia, osteoporosis (see
PRECAUTIONS: Musculoskeletal), pathologic fracture of long bones, steroid
myopathy, tendon rupture (particularly of the Achilles tendon), vertebral compression
fractures.
Neurological/Psychiatric
amnesia, anxiety, benign intracranial hypertension, convulsions, delirium, dementia
(characterized by deficits in memory retention, attention, concentration, mental speed
and efficiency, and occupational performance), depression, dizziness, EEG
abnormalities, emotional instability and irritability, euphoria, hallucinations, headache,
impaired cognition, incidence of severe psychiatric symptoms, increased intracranial
pressure with papilledema (pseudotumor cerebri) usually following discontinuation of
treatment, increased motor activity, insomnia, ischemic neuropathy, long-term memory
loss, mania, mood swings, neuritis, neuropathy, paresthesia, personality changes,
psychiatric disorders including steroid psychoses or aggravation of pre-existing
psychiatric conditions, restlessness, schizophrenia, verbal memory loss, vertigo,
withdrawn behavior.
Ophthalmic
blurred vision, cataracts (including posterior subcapsular cataracts), central serous
chorioretinopathy, establishment of secondary bacterial, fungal and viral infections,
exophthalmos, glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure (see PRECAUTIONS:
Ophthalmic), optic nerve damage, papilledema.
Other
abnormal fat deposits, aggravation/masking of infections, decreased resistance to
infection (see WARNINGS: Infection), hiccups, immunosuppresion, increased or
decreased motility and number of spermatozoa, malaise, insomnia, moon face, pyrexia.
