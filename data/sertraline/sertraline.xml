                     <text>
                        <paragraph>In pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and other antidepressant classes) that included approximately 77,000 adult patients and over 4,500 pediatric patients, the incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in antidepressant-treated patients age 24 years and younger was greater than in placebo-treated patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among drugs, but there was an increased risk identified in young patients for most drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors across the different indications, with the highest incidence in patients with MDD. The drug-placebo differences in the number of cases of suicidal thoughts and behaviors per 1,000 patients treated are provided in Table 1. </paragraph>

However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with MDD that antidepressants delay the recurrence of depression and that depression itself is a risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. </paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="xmChange"/>SSRIs, including Sertraline HCl Capsules, can precipitate serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. The risk is increased with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, meperidine, methadone, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John’s Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin, i.e., MAOIs <content styleCode="italics">[see Contraindications (<linkHtml href="#Section_4">4</linkHtml>), Drug Interactions (<linkHtml href="#Section_7.1">7.1</linkHtml>)]</content>. Serotonin syndrome can also occur when these drugs are used alone. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Serotonin syndrome signs and symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The concomitant use of Sertraline HCl Capsules with MAOIs is contraindicated. In addition, do not initiate Sertraline HCl Capsules in a patient being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral ingestion or local tissue injection). If it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking Sertraline HCl Capsules, discontinue Sertraline HCl Capsules before initiating treatment with the MAOI <content styleCode="italics">[see Contraindications (<linkHtml href="#Section_4">4</linkHtml>), Drug Interactions (<linkHtml href="#Section_7.1">7.1</linkHtml>)]</content>. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Monitor all patients taking Sertraline HCl Capsules for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. Discontinue treatment with Sertraline HCl Capsules and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of Sertraline HCl Capsules with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome and monitor for symptoms.</paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="xmChange"/>Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including Sertraline HCl Capsules, increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Based on data from the published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage <content styleCode="italics">[see Use in Specific Populations (<linkHtml href="#Section_8.1">8.1</linkHtml>)]</content>.

Discuss potential management strategies to support patients in making informed decisions about treatment.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The safety of Sertraline HCl Capsules for the treatment of MDD and OCD is based on adequate and well-controlled studies of another sertraline HCl product. Below is a display of adverse reactions of sertraline HCl (referred to as “sertraline” in this section) from those adequate and well-controlled studies in MDD, OCD, and other conditions. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The data described below reflect exposure in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of sertraline in 3066 adults. These 3066 patients exposed to sertraline for 8 to 12 weeks represent 568 patient-years of exposure. The mean age was 40 years; 57% were females and 43% were males. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The most common adverse reactions (≥5% and twice placebo) in all pooled placebo-controlled clinical trials of all sertraline-treated patients (MDD, OCD, and other conditions) were nausea, diarrhea/loose stool, tremor, dyspepsia, decreased appetite, hyperhidrosis, ejaculation failure, and decreased libido (see Table 2). The following are the most common adverse reactions in trials of sertraline (≥5% and twice placebo) by indication that were not mentioned previously.</paragraph>

However, reliable estimates of the incidence and severity of untoward experiences involving sexual desire, performance and satisfaction are difficult to obtain, in part because patients and healthcare providers may be reluctant to discuss them. Accordingly, estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance cited in labeling may underestimate their actual incidence. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Table 3 below displays the incidence of sexual adverse reactions reported by at least 2% of sertraline -treated patients and twice placebo from pooled placebo-controlled trials of MDD, OCD, and other conditions. For men and all indications, the most common adverse reactions (&gt;2% and twice placebo) included: ejaculation failure, decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, ejaculation disorder, and male sexual dysfunction. For women, the most common adverse reaction (≥2% and twice placebo) was decreased libido. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>False-positive urine immunoassay screening tests for benzodiazepines have been reported in patients taking another sertraline HCl product. This finding is due to lack of specificity of the screening tests. False-positive test results may be expected for several days following discontinuation of Sertraline HCl Capsules. Confirmatory tests, such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, will distinguish sertraline from benzodiazepines.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Based on data from published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#Section_5.3">5.3</linkHtml>) and Clinical Considerations]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Overall, available published epidemiologic studies of pregnant women exposed to sertraline in the first trimester suggest no difference in major birth defect risk compared to the background rate for major birth defects in comparator populations. Some studies have reported increases for specific major birth defects; however, these study results are inconclusive <content styleCode="italics">(see Data)</content>. There are clinical considerations regarding neonates exposed to SSRIs, including Sertraline HCl Capsules, during the third trimester of pregnancy <content styleCode="italics">(see Clinical Considerations)</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph> Although no malformations were observed in animal reproduction studies, delayed fetal ossification was observed when sertraline was administered during the period of organogenesis at doses less than the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) in rats and doses approximately 4 times the MRHD in rabbits on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis in adults. When sertraline was administered to female rats during the last third of gestation, there was an increase in the number of stillborn pups and pup deaths during the first four days after birth at the MRHD <content styleCode="italics">(see Data)</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph> The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown.

                        <paragraph> Third Trimester Exposure </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Neonates exposed to sertraline and other SSRIs late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. These findings are based on post-marketing reports. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These features are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs or, possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. In some cases, the clinical picture was consistent with serotonin syndrome <content styleCode="italics">[see Warnings and Precautions (<linkHtml href="#Section_5.2">5.2</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph> Exposure during late pregnancy to SSRIs may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1 to 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality. In a retrospective case-control study of 377 women whose infants were born with PPHN and 836 women whose infants were born healthy, the risk for developing PPHN was approximately six-fold higher for infants exposed to SSRIs after the 20<sup>th </sup>week of gestation compared to infants who had not been exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. A study of 831,324 infants born in Sweden in 1997 to 2005 found a PPHN risk ratio of 2.4 (95% CI 1.2 to 4.3) associated with patient-reported maternal use of SSRIs “in early pregnancy” and a PPHN risk ratio of 3.6 (95% CI 1.2 to 8.3) associated with a combination of patient-reported maternal use of SSRIs “in early pregnancy” and an antenatal SSRI prescription “in later pregnancy”.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph> First Trimester Exposure </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The weight of evidence from epidemiologic studies of pregnant women exposed to sertraline in the first trimester suggest no difference in major birth defect risk compared to the background rate for major birth defects in pregnant women who were not exposed to sertraline. A meta-analysis of studies suggest no increase in the risk of total malformations (summary odds ratio=1.01, 95% CI=0.88 to 1.17) or cardiac malformations (summary odds ratio=0.93, 95% CI=0.70 to 1.23) among offspring of women with first trimester exposure to sertraline. An increased risk of congenital cardiac defects, specifically septal defects, the most common type of congenital heart defect, was observed in some published epidemiologic studies with first trimester sertraline exposure; however, most of these studies were limited by the use of comparison populations that did not allow for the control of confounders such as the underlying depression and associated conditions and behaviors, which may be factors associated with increased risk of these malformations.</paragraph>

                           <content styleCode="italics">Animal Data</content>
                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph> Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 80 mg/kg/day and 40 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses correspond to approximately 4 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 200 mg/day on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis in adults. There was no evidence of malformation at any dose level. When pregnant rats and rabbits were given sertraline during the period of organogenesis, delayed ossification was observed in fetuses at doses of 10 mg/kg (0.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis) in rats and 40 mg/kg (3.9 times the MRHD on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis) in rabbits. When female rats received sertraline during the last third of gestation and throughout lactation, there was an increase in stillborn pups and pup deaths during the first 4 days after birth. Pup body weights were also decreased during the first four days after birth. These effects occurred at a dose of 20 mg/kg (1 times the MRHD on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis). The no effect dose for rat pup mortality was 10 mg/kg (0.5 times the MRHD on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis). The decrease in pup survival was shown to be due to in utero exposure to sertraline. The clinical significance of these effects is unknown.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph> In a pooled analysis of two 10-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible dose (50 to 200 mg) outpatient trials for MDD (n=373) with another sertraline HCl product, there was a difference in weight change between sertraline HCl and placebo of roughly 1 kg, for both pediatric patients ages 6 to 11 and pediatric patients ages 12 to 17, in both age groups representing a slight weight loss for the sertraline HCl group compared to a slight gain for the placebo group. For pediatric patients (ages 6 to 11), about 7% of the sertraline HCl-treated patients had a weight loss greater than 7% of body weight compared to 0% of the placebo-treated patients; for pediatric patients (ages 12 to 17), about 2% of sertraline HCl-treated patients had a weight loss &gt; 7% of body weight compared to about 1% of placebo-treated patients.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph> A subset of patients who completed the randomized controlled trials in patients with MDD (sertraline n=99, placebo n=122) were continued into a 24-week, flexible-dose, open-label, extension study. Those subjects who completed 34 weeks of sertraline HCl treatment (10 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial + 24 weeks open-label, n=68) had weight gain that was similar to that expected using data from age-adjusted peers. However, there are no studies that directly evaluate the long-term effects of sertraline HCl on the growth, development, and maturation in pediatric patients.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph> A study conducted in juvenile rats at clinically relevant doses showed delay in sexual maturation, but there was no effect on fertility in either males or females.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph> In this study in which juvenile rats were treated with oral doses of sertraline at 0, 10, 40 or 80 mg/kg/day from postnatal day 21 to 56, a delay in sexual maturation was observed in males treated with 80 mg/kg/day and females treated with doses ≥10 mg/kg/day. There was no effect on male and female reproductive endpoints or neurobehavioral development up to the highest dose tested (80 mg/kg/day), except a decrease in auditory startle response in females at 40 and 80 mg/kg/day at the end of treatment but not at the end of the drug-free period. The highest dose of 80 mg/kg/day produced plasma levels (AUC) of sertraline 5 times those seen in pediatric patients (6 to 17 years of age) receiving the maximum recommended dose of sertraline (200 mg/day).</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Of the total number of patients with MDD, OCD, and other conditions in clinical studies with another sertraline product, 797 (17%) were ≥ 65 years old, while 197 (4%) were ≥ 75 years old.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Sertraline undergoes extensive first pass metabolism. The principal initial pathway of metabolism for sertraline is N-demethylation. N-desmethylsertraline has a plasma terminal elimination half-life of 62 to 104 hours. Both <content styleCode="italics">in vitro </content>biochemical and <content styleCode="italics">in vivo </content>pharmacological testing have shown N-desmethylsertraline to be substantially less active than sertraline.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Both sertraline and N-desmethylsertraline undergo oxidative deamination and subsequent reduction, hydroxylation, and glucuronide conjugation. In a study of radiolabeled sertraline involving two healthy male subjects, sertraline accounted for less than 5% of the plasma radioactivity. About 40 to 45% of the administered radioactivity was recovered in urine in 9 days. Unchanged sertraline was not detectable in the urine. For the same period, about 40 to 45% of the administered radioactivity was accounted for in feces, including 12 to 14% unchanged sertraline.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph> Desmethylsertraline exhibits time-related, dose dependent increases in AUC (0 to 24-hour), C<sub>max</sub> and C<sub>min</sub>, with about a 5- to 9-fold increase in these pharmacokinetic parameters between day 1 and day 14.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Many antidepressant drugs (e.g., SSRIs, including sertraline, and most tricyclic antidepressant drugs) inhibit the biochemical activity of the drug metabolizing isozyme CYP2D6 (debrisoquin hydroxylase), and, thus, may increase the plasma concentrations of co-administered drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6. The drugs for which this potential interaction is of greatest concern are those metabolized primarily by CYP2D6 and that have a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., tricyclic antidepressant drugs and the Type 1C antiarrhythmics propafenone and flecainide). The extent to which this interaction is an important clinical problem depends on the extent of the inhibition of CYP2D6 by the antidepressant and the therapeutic index of the co-administered drug. There is variability among the drugs effective in the treatment of MDD in the extent of clinically important 2D6 inhibition, and in fact sertraline at lower doses has a less prominent inhibitory effect on 2D6 than some others in the class. Nevertheless, even sertraline has the potential for clinically important 2D6 inhibition <content styleCode="italics">[see Drug Interactions (<linkHtml href="#Section_7.1">7.1</linkHtml>)]</content>.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The efficacy of Sertraline HCl Capsules for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adult patients is based upon adequate and well-controlled studies of another sertraline HCl product (referred to as “sertraline” in this section). The results of these adequate and well-controlled studies of sertraline are presented below.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The efficacy of sertraline as a treatment for MDD was established in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies and one double-blind, randomized-withdrawal study following an open label study in adult (ages 18 to 65) outpatients who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III) criteria for MDD (studies MDD-1 and MDD-2).</paragraph>

                           <item>Study MDD-1 was an 8-week, 3-arm study with flexible dosing of sertraline, amitriptyline, and placebo. Adult patients received sertraline (N=126, in a daily dose titrated weekly to 50 mg, 100 mg, or 200 mg), amitriptyline (N=123, in a daily dose titrated weekly to 50 mg, 100 mg, or 150 mg), or placebo (N= 130).</item>
                           <item>Study MDD-2 was a 6-week, multicenter parallel study of three fixed doses of sertraline administered once daily at 50 mg (N=82), 100 mg (N=75), and 200 mg (N=56) doses and placebo (N=76) in the treatment of adult outpatients with MDD.</item>
                        </list>
                        <paragraph>Overall, these studies demonstrated sertraline to be superior to placebo on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17) and the Clinical Global Impression Severity (CGI-S) of Illness and Global Improvement (CGI-I) scores. Study MDD-2 was not readily interpretable regarding a dose response relationship for effectiveness. </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>A third study (Study MDD-3) involved adult outpatients meeting the DSM-III criteria for MDD who had responded by the end of an initial 8-week open treatment phase on sertraline 50 to 200 mg/day. These patients (n=295) were randomized to continuation on double-blind sertraline 50 to 200 mg/day or placebo for 44 weeks. A statistically significantly lower relapse rate was observed for patients taking sertraline compared to those on placebo: sertraline [n=11 (8%)] and placebo [n=31 (39%)]. The mean sertraline dose for completers was 70 mg/day. </paragraph>

                        <paragraph> The efficacy of Sertraline HCl Capsules for the treatment of OCD in adults and pediatric patients ages 6 to 17 years is based upon adequate and well-controlled studies of another sertraline HCl product (referred to as “sertraline” in this section). The results of these adequate and well-controlled studies of sertraline are presented below.</paragraph>

                        </paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The effectiveness of sertraline in the treatment of OCD was demonstrated in three multicenter placebo-controlled studies of adult (age 18 to 65) non-depressed outpatients (Studies OCD-1, OCD-2, and OCD-3). Patients in all three studies had moderate to severe OCD (DSM-III or DSM-III-R) with mean baseline ratings on the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) total score ranging from 23 to 25.  </paragraph>
                        <list listType="unordered" styleCode="disc">
                           <item>Study OCD-1 was an 8-week randomized, placebo-controlled study with flexible dosing of sertraline in a range of 50 to 200 mg/day, titrated in 50 mg increments every 4 days to a maximally tolerated dose; the mean dose for completers was 186 mg/day. Patients receiving sertraline (N=43) experienced a mean reduction of approximately 4 points on the Y-BOCS total score which was statistically significantly greater than the mean reduction of 2 points in placebo-treated patients (N=44). The mean change in Y-BOCS from baseline to last visit (the primary efficacy endpoint) was -3.79 (sertraline) and -1.48 (placebo). </item>
                           <item>Study OCD-2 was a 12-week randomized, placebo-controlled fixed-dose study, including sertraline doses of 50, 100, and 200 mg/day. Sertraline (N=240) was titrated to the assigned dose over two weeks in 50 mg increments every 4 days. Patients receiving sertraline doses of 50 and 200 mg/day experienced mean reductions of approximately 6 points on the Y-BOCS total score, which were statistically significantly greater than the approximately 3 point reduction in placebo-treated patients (N=84). The mean change in Y-BOCS from baseline to last visit (the primary efficacy endpoint) was -5.7 (pooled results from sertraline 50 mg, 100 mg, and 150 mg) and -2.85 (placebo). </item>
                           <item>Study OCD-3 was a 12-week randomized, placebo controlled study with flexible dosing of sertraline in a range of 50 to 200 mg/day; the mean dose for completers was 185 mg/day. Sertraline (N=241) was titrated to the assigned dose over two weeks in 50 mg increments every 4 days. Patients receiving sertraline experienced a mean reduction of approximately 7 points on the Y-BOCS total score which was statistically significantly greater than the mean reduction of approximately 4 points in placebo-treated patients (N=84). The mean change in Y-BOCS from baseline to last visit (the primary efficacy endpoint) was - 6.5 (sertraline) and -3.6 (placebo).</item>

                        <paragraph> The effectiveness of sertraline was studied in the risk reduction of OCD relapse. In Study OCD-4, patients ranging in age from 18 to 79 meeting DSM-III-R criteria for OCD who had responded during a 52-week single-blind trial on sertraline 50 to 200 mg/day (n=224) were randomized to continuation of sertraline or to substitution of placebo for up to 28 weeks of observation for analysis of discontinuation due to relapse or insufficient clinical response. Response during the single-blind phase was defined as a decrease in the Y-BOCS score of ≥ 25% compared to baseline and a CGI-I of 1 (very much improved), 2 (much improved) or 3 (minimally improved). Insufficient clinical response during the double-blind phase indicated a worsening of the patient’s condition that resulted in study discontinuation, as assessed by the investigator. Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as the following conditions being met (on three consecutive visits for 1 and 2, and condition 3 being met at visit 3):  </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Patients receiving continued sertraline treatment experienced a statistically significantly lower rate of discontinuation due to relapse or insufficient clinical response over the subsequent 28 weeks compared to those receiving placebo.

                        <paragraph>The effectiveness of sertraline for the treatment of OCD was demonstrated in a 12-week, multicenter, placebo-controlled, parallel group study in a pediatric outpatient population (ages 6 to 17) (Study OCD-5). Sertraline (N=92) was initiated at doses of either 25 mg/day (pediatric patients ages 6 to 12) or 50 mg/day (pediatric patients ages 13 to 17), and then titrated at 3 and 4 day intervals (25 mg incremental dose for pediatric patients ages 6 to 12) or 1 week intervals (50 mg incremental dose for pediatric patients ages 13 to 17) over the next four weeks to a maximum dose of 200 mg/day, as tolerated. The mean dose for completers was 178 mg/day. Dosing was once a day in the morning or evening. Patients in this study had moderate to severe OCD (DSM-III-R) with mean baseline ratings on the Children’s Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) total score of 22. Patients receiving sertraline experienced a mean reduction of approximately 7 units on the CY-BOCS total score which was statistically significantly greater than the 3 unit reduction for placebo patients (n=95). Analyses for age and gender effects on outcome did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of age or sex.</paragraph>
